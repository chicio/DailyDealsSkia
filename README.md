# React Native Background Shape Skia Svg

[![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chicio/Daily-Deals-Skia-SVG/master/LICENSE.md)

An example project for my blog post "React Native is Native:
drawing customized background shapes with React Native Skia and React Native SVG".

### Description

This repository contains an example of how
is it possible to draw native alike background shape using powerful 2D graphics frameworks like React Native Skia,
or by leveraging the SVG drawing using React Native SVG.

> ...Recently, I had the opportunity to work on a component that could spark this kind of discussion. Essentially, I had
to create a text component with a custom-shaped background and coordinated animations within it.
Although I may not be as skilled as the developers I mentioned earlier, in this blog post I will demonstrate two
possible ways to achieve the same result of a pure native component for this type of development.
To do this, I will use two different frameworks: React Native Skia and React native SVG...

These are the components created in the example.
